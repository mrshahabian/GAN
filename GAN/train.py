    Return the loss of the discriminator given inputs.
    Parameters:
        gen: the generator model, which returns an image given z-dimensional noise
        disc: the discriminator model, which returns a single-dimensional prediction of real/fake
        criterion: the loss function, which should be used to compare
               the discriminator's predictions to the ground truth reality of the images
               (e.g. fake = 0, real = 1)
        real: a batch of real images
        num_images: the number of images the generator should produce,
                which is also the length of the real images
        z_dim: the dimension of the noise vector, a scalar
        device: the device type
    Returns:

    #     These are the steps you will need to complete:
    #       1) Create noise vectors and generate a batch (num_images) of fake images.
    #            Make sure to pass the device argument to the noise.
    #       2) Get the discriminator's prediction of the fake image
    #            and calculate the loss. Don't forget to detach the generator!
    #            (Remember the loss function you set earlier -- criterion. You need a
    #            'ground truth' tensor in order to calculate the loss.
    #            For example, a ground truth tensor for a fake image is all zeros.)
    #       3) Get the discriminator's prediction of the real image and calculate the loss.
    #       4) Calculate the discriminator's loss by averaging the real and fake loss
    #            and set it to disc_loss.
    #     *Important*: You should NOT write your own loss function here - use criterion(pred, true)!
